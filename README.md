This project is a sample of what I have
an opportunity to learn during graphical course
hosted by my University.
BubbleGame is simple arcade game which utilizes
OpenGL. It's code is based on https://learnopengl.com.
It that rewards your fast reflexes. You have to
avoid contact with constantly rising bubbles inside
aquarium and reach the great yellow bubble in order to
go to the next level (which basically teleports 
you to the next leve, with move obstacles).

This project shows how Phong light model can be 
applied in 3D space. Also light is gradually diminishing
based on Beer-Lambert law. There is a directional light
as well as 20 randomly selected bubbles that wmit their
own light. Effects may vary based on parameters of aquarium
size and constants used.

Beside this our bubble is fully operable. You can use
two different cameras to controll it. Spheres are generated
using simple glm:: functions, which have proven to be
very helpful.

Backgroud uses textures, to symulate feeling
of being under water.

Be carefull! If you touch bubbles you get
teleported right to the start!
